# 1. List values

list = [1, 2, 3]; print(list)


# Loren - First I had to fix it for Python3 print syntax. I would also suggest that you copy the entire text describing
# each challenge as a comment to make it easier for me to navigate. This task needs some amendment, as you manually
# removed the items < 5, you need to do this in code from the whole list:

list2 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 20, 32, 46, 85]

# Find values less than 5.
